Multi-Objective Approach for Energy-Aware Workflow Scheduling Using an Effective Algorithm in Cloud Computing Environment.
=================
## About
This is an implemntation of simulation of an Workflow Scheduling Algorithm (a two dimensional Ant Colony Optimization) proposed by me in cloud computing environment.
This is a part of my M.Tech. thesis work.
